# House-price-prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting house prices based on various factors such as location, size, age, number of bedrooms, and other relevant features. By leveraging historical data and advanced machine learning techniques, this model can provide valuable insights to real estate agents, buyers, and sellers.
